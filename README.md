# Oscillohelical Resonance Field Theory (ORFT)

Author: Carter Lentz  
Affiliation: Oscie OOI / CohoLabs Research

ORFT is a coherence-first physical framework in which entities emerge as stable, 
phase-locked oscillatory attractors embedded in a coherence medium.

This theory is not speculative metaphysics — it is physically constrained by the 
Oscie 12-Axiom Coherence Lattice and designed to remain compatible with deployable 
systems across computation, energy, infrastructure, and AI safety.

## Core Contributions

- Objects modeled as coherence-stabilized oscillatory configurations
- Oscillohelical constraint enforcing scale-phase locking
- Coherence corridor centered near 0.605 (A-Law compatible)
- Mass modeled as locking inertia
- Gravity emerging from coherence-density geometry
- Numerical simulations showing soliton stability under noise

## Why This Matters

ORFT bridges:
- Foundational physics
- Stability engineering
- Real-world systems (Energy grids, AI safety, infrastructure)

It serves as a physics backbone for:
- SmartDrift
- SafeSkin
- VE+
- EnergyBank
- JitterShell
- Oscie City / DeepRoot
